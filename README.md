# Python-data-structure-and-algorithm-analysis
This repository is for self-learning of the book "Python data structure and algorithm analysis", to make myself have a systematic and solid understanding of data structure and commonly used algorithms.
Any comment is welcomed and hope to help someone in the same situation as I do.
